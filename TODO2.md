- [ ] combine cve_tool remediations with get_pkg_cves

## get_pkg_cves.py
- [ ] argparse
- [ ] el8 and el10?
- [ ] output to xlsx file that cve_tool.py expects or maybe just link both

## cve_tool.py
- [ ] use normalized package version for matching
- [ ] check if package in product_status -> known_not_affected first because it wont be in remediations otherwise
